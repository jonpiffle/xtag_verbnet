Note that this appears to be the most appropriate class. However, a number of
the verbs in the VN class split-23.3 are not ergative and, so, are not listed
in the XTAG grammar as members of this tree family. Examples of such verbs
include 'blow,' 'cut,' 'draw,' 'hack,' 'hew,' and 'hack.' (this list is not exhaustive)

In VerbNet this frame appears only in the turn-26.6 class. Therefore, seven
verbs ('alter,' 'change,' 'convert,' 'metamorphose,' 'transform,' 'transmute,'
and 'turn') take this frame in VerbNet. Six of these verbs can appear in Basic
Intransitive and Basic Transitive frames, and, so, in XTAG for these verbs this
construction would be classified as a transitive sentence with prepositional
adjuncts. However, the verb 'turn,' is
considered by XTAG as belonging to
tree family TRnx0Vnx1Pnx2 (resultatives with a PP anchor), in this instance as
one cannot say "The witch turned
the frog" with the interpretation that the frog transformed.

Note: XTAG specifies that no verb should appear both in 6.1 and 6.11. Whereas
Prep following the verb are optional in 6.1, in 6.11 the verbs require a Prep
to be grammatical. This was a difficult choice as the 6.11 tree family does not
require a specific preposition to serve as the anchor of the PP. However, among
the verbs participating in the Conative Alternation, many, if not most, appear
to also participate in alternations with other preps. For instance, "Mary cut
the bread" could alternate with "Mary cut at the bread" or "Mary cut into the
bread."

<primary="Fulfilling Alternation"  secondary="" xtag="Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2" name="Multiple anchor ditransitive with PP">
<note>
I wonder about this assignment. In truth this is not an obvious assignment as
the Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2 tree family is meant to be restricted to verbs which are
obligatorily ditransitive. While some of the VerbNet verbs that take the
Fulfilling Alternation have this property, others do not. For instance, the
verb 'equip' may occur in Transitive situations. It is perfectly allowable to
say "I equipped the entire expedition" without specifying the materials given
to the recipients. However, the same cannot be said for 'entrust,' which
obligatorily requires a PP introduced by 'with' to follow the Direct Object. I
chose this tree family on the basis of the underlying interpretation of the
Fulfilling Alternation and the observation that in most cases, purely
transitive sentences such as those exhibited by 'equip' are not grammatical
under the relevant interpretation (although 'equip,' 'arm,' and 'reward'
nonwithstanding).

This instance was very difficult at first because of the example (which I am

sentences such as "The bag bulges with grocercies" or "His bag bulged with

To my ear, these verbs usually sound stitlted when occuring alone. However,
they are perfectly natural given the correct context (usually as answers to
questions about what one was doing). In the XTAG the verbs taking this frame

This is a problematic case. The frame occurs in two VN classes:
being_dressed-41.3.3 and marvel-31.3. In the case of the being_dressed-41.3.3
verbs, the frame is a passivized version of a ditransitive verb with a PP,
which corresponds to XTAG: 6.5 Ditransitive with PP( Tnx0Vnx1pnx2). In the
case of the marvel-31.3 verbs, the frame is a passivized version of the
following XTAG family: 6.12 Multiple anchor PP complement: Tnx01VPnx1. In
truth, I fail to see the purpose of the Passive frame in VerbNet.
